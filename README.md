# Fare Evasion 

I'm a senior at NYU, this is the repository with all the code I've written for my thesis. I'm studying fare evasion arrests in New York City. All the important helper functions are in `process.py`. I generally `import process as fe` (stands for fare evasion). The `Interactive Maps` notebook demonstrates a lot of the functionality, and I'll be adding more as I have time. Overall, the goal of these functions is to make interfacing with and aggregating publicly available arrest data easy for researchers. Pretty much all of them were written to make my own life easier during my research, but I'd like to have a consistent, sensible, and flexible workflow for this repo by the end of the project.

If you'd like to interactively explore this data, go to [the github pages version of this repo][1]

## Instructions and Requirements 

All the data needed to explore fare evasion arrests is included in this repo (the process by which I created the data sets will be added here shortly, and be explained in an upcoming paper). If you would like to recreate this data set from the source, or with alternative parameters, you must first download the [Year-To-Date][2] and the [Historic][3] arrest record data sets from NY Open Data to the `data` directory. Instructions for replicating the data set with different parameters can be found in the `Filter Arrests` notebook.
